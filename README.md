## Developer Operations

## Game Development
* [r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/): r/GameDev on Reddit is a community of 400K+ game developers that shares the latest techniques, tips and news, all related to the AAA and indie game development industry. You will find interesting project displays, blogs and technical help in this subreddit, all at one place.
* [Game Developers Conference](https://www.gdconf.com/): The Game Developers Conference (GDC) brings the game development community together to exchange ideas, solve problems, and shape the future of the industry across five days of education, inspiration, and networking. Attendees include programmers, artists, producers, game designers, audio professionals, and business leaders. Check out the talks that happen at GDC on [their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ).
* [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/): A site with great visual and interactive explanations of algorithms and data structures, mostly related to game development. A great place to learn and understand Procedural Generation/Textures. 

### 3D graphics

* [Paul Bourke](http://paulbourke.net/): A site explaining stuff used in advanced 3D graphics, mostly procedural stuff. A specific page to get you started would be [this Noise article](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/noise/) where you'll find some creative uses of noise functions in terrain generation.
* [Procedural World](http://procworld.blogspot.com/): This site is completely dedicated to Procedural Generation. A highly suggested read would be [this page](http://procworld.blogspot.com/2014/01/leveling-lakes.html) which suggests an approach to flatten bumpiness in lake-beds generated due to noise.

## Information Security
* [liveoverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w): liveoverflow is a member of team Alles and makes videos about CTFs, bug hunting and cool vulnerabitlies, focusing primarily on binary exploitation and reverse engineering with occasional content about web security. His binary exploitation series, though a little tough to follow at first, is a great resource for beginners looking to get started in the field of infosec

* [PortSwigger academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security): PortSwigger offers detailed theory and a number of accompanying practice labs for popular web app vulnerabilities

## Software Development

## Machine Learning

## Competitive Programming

## Language Specific

### C++

* [TheChernoProject](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject): TheCherno has been a quite valuable resource while developing our game engines, viz. [Rubeus](https://github.com/sdslabs/rootex) and [Rootex](https://github.com/sdslabs/rootex) (ongoing). This YouTube channel dives into advanced topics of C++ (although his earlier videos taught Java) occasionally while keeping a solid foundation based on just one thing: Building good C++ software. You will not find any random videos on things you will probably never use.
