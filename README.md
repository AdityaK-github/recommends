## Distributed Systems

* [Distributed Systems for fun and profit](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/single-page.html): Distributed systems for fun and profit is an e-book focused on distributed programming and systems concepts one will need to understand commercial systems in the data center. The book is an excellent starting point for delving into distributed systems programming with resources to dive deep into some concepts.
* [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://github.com/Yang-Yanxiang/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications/blob/master/Designing%20Data%20Intensive%20Applications.pdf): Designing data-intensive applications is an excellent book that bridges the massive gap between distributed systems theory and practical engineering. It helps developers make smart decisions as they design and implement data infrastructure and systems.
* [Designing Distributed Systems](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/designing-distributed-systems/): Designing Distributed Systems is a 160 pages e-book containing an introduction to distributed system concepts along with a more in-depth explanation for building robust distributed systems.

## Competitive Programming

## Game Development

* [r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/): r/GameDev on Reddit is a community of 400K+ game developers that shares the latest techniques, tips and news, all related to the AAA and indie game development industry. You will find interesting project displays, blogs and technical help in this subreddit, all at one place.
* [Game Developers Conference](https://www.gdconf.com/): The Game Developers Conference (GDC) brings the game development community together to exchange ideas, solve problems, and shape the future of the industry across five days of education, inspiration, and networking. Attendees include programmers, artists, producers, game designers, audio professionals, and business leaders. Check out the talks that happen at GDC on [their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JB7TSe49lg56u6qH8y_MQ).

## Information Security

* [liveoverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w): liveoverflow is a member of team Alles and makes videos about CTFs, bug hunting and cool vulnerabitlies, focusing primarily on binary exploitation and reverse engineering with occasional content about web security. His binary exploitation series, though a little tough to follow at first, is a great resource for beginners looking to get started in the field of infosec
* [PortSwigger academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security): PortSwigger offers detailed theory and a number of accompanying practice labs for popular web app vulnerabilities

## Language Specific

### C++

* [TheChernoProject](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject): TheCherno has been a quite valuable resource while developing our game engines, viz. [Rubeus](https://github.com/sdslabs/rootex) and [Rootex](https://github.com/sdslabs/rootex) (ongoing). This YouTube channel dives into advanced topics of C++ (although his earlier videos taught Java) occasionally while keeping a solid foundation based on just one thing: Building good C++ software. You will not find any random videos on things you will probably never use.

## Machine Learning

## Software Development

## System Administration

* [SysAdvent](https://sysadvent.blogspot.com/): SysAdvent is a blog that posts one article about system administration for each day of December, with the goal.
* [KataKoda](https://www.katacoda.com/): Katacoda is an interactive learning and training platform for software developers focusing on system administration. Each student is given access to a new environment without the need to install all the required components by themselves.
